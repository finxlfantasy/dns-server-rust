# DNS Server in Rust

This repository contains a simple DNS server implemented in Rust. The server can handle incoming DNS requests, parse them, and generate appropriate responses. Below are the key components and functionalities of the server.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download it from here.

**Clone the Repository**:


The server will start listening on the port specified in the code.

## Components

1. **DNSHeader**: This struct represents the header of a DNS message. It includes fields like `id`, `qr`, `opcode`, `aa`, `tc`, `rd`, `ra`, `z`, `rcode`, `qdcount`, `ancount`, `nscount`, and `arcount`.

2. **DNSQuestion**: This struct represents a DNS question. It includes fields like `domain_name`, `query_type`, and `query_class`.

3. **DNSAnswer**: This struct represents a DNS answer. It includes fields like `domain_name`, `query_type`, `query_class`, `ttl`, `rdlength`, and `rdata`.

## Usage

To use this DNS server, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. Then, you can run the server with the command `cargo run`.

## Customizing Responses

You can easily customize the server’s behavior by modifying the DNSHeader, DNSQuestion, and DNSAnswer structs. Here are some ideas:

1. **Dynamic Content**: Instead of fixed responses, generate dynamic content based on the request. For example, fetch data from a database or an external API.

2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling by adding appropriate status codes and error messages. For instance, handle invalid request paths with a custom error response.

3. **Security Measures**: Consider security aspects. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Validate input data to prevent injection attacks.

### `DNSAnswer`

This struct represents a DNS answer. It includes fields like `domain_name`, `query_type`, `query_class`, `ttl`, `rdlength`, and `rdata`.

It has one method:
- `to_bytes(&self) -> Vec<u8>`: This method converts the `DNSAnswer` to bytes.

### `DNSQuery`

This struct represents a DNS query. It includes fields like `header` and `question_section`.

It has two methods:
- `new(id: u16, question: DNSQuestion) -> DNSQuery`: This method creates a new `DNSQuery`.
- `from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<DNSQuery, ServerError>`: This method creates a `DNSQuery` from bytes.

### `DNSPacket`

This struct represents a DNS packet. It includes fields like `header`, `question_section`, and `answer_section`.

It has two methods:
- `for_request(query: DNSQuery) -> DNSPacket`: This method creates a new `DNSPacket` for a given request.
- `to_bytes(&self) -> Vec<u8>`: This method converts the `DNSPacket` to bytes.

## Usage

To use this DNS server, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. Then, you can run the server with the command `cargo run`.
